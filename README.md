# ACKRep Deployment Utils

## General Information

This repository contains the code that runs on <demo.ackrep.org>. It should also provide a starting point to deploy an own instance.

## Deployment concept

The ackrep project consists of several components which are maintained each in their own repository.


**Functional Components**

- *[ackrep_core](https://github.com/cknoll/ackrep_core)*
    - main code of the ackrep engine and command-line-interface (cli)
- *[ackrep_data](https://github.com/cknoll/ackrep_data)*
    - actual data for the repository
- (*[ackrep_web](https://github.com/cknoll/ackrep_core/tree/main/ackrep_web)*)
    - code for the web front-end
    - currently still part of ackrep_core

**Auxiliary Components**

- *ackrep_deployment*
    - code for simple deployment of the functional components on a virtual server
- *custom_settings*
    - data used for customization and maintainance. For privacy and security reasons these settings are not published.

<a name="directory-layout"></a>
These components are represented by the following **directory layout**:

    <ackrep_project_dir>/
    ├── ackrep_deployment/                ← repo with deployment code for the ackrep project
    │  ├── .git/
    │  ├── README.md                      ← the currently displayed file (README.md)
    │  ├── deploy.py                      ← deployment script
    │  ├── ...
    │  ├── custom_settings__demo          ← instance-specific settings (not included in the repo)
    │  │   ├── settings.yml
    │  │   └── ...
    │  └── custom_settings__local         ← settings for local testing deployment (included for reference)
    │      ├── settings.yml
    │      └── ...
    │
    │
    │
    ├── ackrep_data/                      ← separate repository for ackrep_data
    │  ├── .git/
    │  └── ...
    │
    ├── ackrep_data_for_unittests/        ← expected to be a clone/copy of ackrep_data
    │  ├── .git/                            (must be created manually)
    │  └── ...
    └── ackrep_core/                      ← separate repository for ackrep_core
       ├── .git/
       └── ...

The components  *ackrep_core* and *ackrep_data* are maintained in separate repositories.
For the deployment to work it is expected to clone them separately one level up in the directory structure.

### Deployment Steps:

The deployment process is triggered by the command `python deploy.py <path_to/settings.yml>` and consists of the following steps (not all of them are currently implemented):

**steps for local and remote deployment**
- create configuration files such as `site_specific_settings.py` from templates with data from `settings.yml`

**steps only for remote deployment**
- stop currently running ackrep-related services on the target server
- upload (rsync) all project data
- restart all running ackrep-related services on the target server
- perform tests (not yet implemented)

**steps only for local deployment**
- manually start development server: `python manage.py runserver` from the ackrep_core directory.


### Container Concept:

On the (testing) production system there are several containers:
- `ackrep-core` (running the django web service)
- one or more *runner*-services which execute the *check-solution-jobs*
    - `ackrep-runner-python3.7`


These containers communicate via shared directories ("docker volumes"):
